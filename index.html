              <p>
               In Bavaria, a state in southern Germany, wellness is considered to be essential to daily living.  Even small towns have a municipal spa that usually has at least one pool where the family can swim and then they have an adults-only spa area.  Why adults only?  Well, they are naked spas!  Not in the icky American sense that you probably just got.  It is about wellness, not checking each other out.  They will have at least one sauna, but usually more, as well as a large hot/warm tub, a warm soak area, an ice cold plunge pool, sometimes a steam sauna, an outside tanning area, an inside resting area with cushioned lounges or zero gravity chairs, and most likely a bar with light snacks.

              <h2 class="center">The Price of Wellness</h2>
              <p>
               In America, we pay a very high price to use spa facilities for an hour or so.  In Germany, they pay from maybe $10 (&euro; 9.40) to $50 (&euro; 47) for the whole day.  And they literally spend the whole day there!  They lay on the loungers, reading books or napping.  They go in the steam sauna and layer the provided salts on their bodies (or the neighbor‚Äôs back if requested) and just sweat.  Then they shower quickly before sinking into the cold pool for a bit.  And yes, you are naked when you go into a pool or a sauna, but otherwise, you are wrapped in a towel or a robe. After a little bit of time passes, it is time for a great local beer and a freshly baked buttered pretzel.  And while this is all wonderful and worth the price of admission, the real appeal for me comes from the Aufguss.

              <h2 class="center">What is an Aufguss?</h2>
              <p>
               Aufguss is a German word meaning infusion and it is a wellness ritual that takes place in the sauna where an Aufgussmeister (Sauna Master) pours water mixed with essential oils over the hot stones of the sauna stove and then they direct the steam towards the customers/devotees in an elaborate towel fanning ritual.  While doing this, they might tell a story about the flowers they picked to create the essential oil or some funny tale that sets all the German-speaking folks laughing.  What I do know is that when they direct the steam in your direction, it feels like a 20-degree difference.  And it turns into a challenge.  From before it even starts, the people who want the most extreme heat sit on the highest-level seating.  It makes a big difference.  Then you can also let the Aufgussmeister know if you want more heat your way.  And where is your towel? It is on the wood seating in the sauna to keep your body from directly touching and sweating on the wood.

              <h2 class="center">A Different Type of Water Park</h2>
              <p>
               Outside of Munich, there is a spa complex, Therme Erding, which is basically the Disney World of saunas and spa life.  It has a gorgeous hotel, designed as though it were a beautiful ship, a large family-oriented water park, a family-accessible and bathing-suits-required spa area with hot tubs, pools, and saunas, and then an adults-only spa area.  It is a strange experience walking from the family area into the adults-only area.  The sound level goes from ROAR to whispering, from stressful to soothing.  There are people sitting in the various restaurants, in their towels or robes, eating anything from a fancy Italian meal to a buttered pretzel or gelato.  There are many pools including one large one that transitions from indoor to outdoors that has many walk-up bars, various types of waterworks and jets and hot tubs built in.  Surrounding this main attraction are many different types of lounging furniture, from a simple chaise lounge, to basically a thin bed.  And there are many other areas to rest throughout‚Ä¶. Maybe you sleep best with a fire going, well, go to the fire room.  Or with complete darkness and a light show on the ceiling‚Ä¶ they have a room for you.  So many sleeping people, completely relaxed and worry-free.

              <p>
               The Aufguss options are amazing.  They have a giant information board in the center room that lists all the different saunas, says what heat/temperature they are, who will be the Aufgussmeister at what times, what ‚Äúshow‚Äù it will have, and even what scent.  If you like roses, you can go to the rose sauna, which is fairly small and every bit of wall and ceiling is covered in dried roses and after the aufguss ceremony, you exit to a tea cart serving hot rose tea.  If you like meditation, you can go to the meditation spa, where they might be using the metal singing bowls and some type of face mask.  They have some that like to get everyone clapping and singing with popsicles or juice served after.  There are a few that have fairly dramatic performances which you have to experience to really appreciate, ranging from a Mama Mia sing-along/musical play to a super intense, loud music, gothic-feeling Aufguss with a hooded-cloak and giant-flag/towel waving Aufgussmeister in a large outbuilding that seats around 100 people on possibly 6 or 7 levels of seating in a large circular room.  The rooms go from just warm to blistering heat, with the hottest sauna sitting at a robust 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit).  They have seasonal programs too.  During Octoberfest, the pair leading the aufguss in a fairly large, ridiculously hot sauna were wearing legit leather lederhosen and getting everyone to sing and clap while standing near the fire that was burning our skin off.

              <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">
               As Americans, of course, we wanted to go to every Aufguss possible, so there was a lot less time spent focusing on the restful side as we raced from one end of the complex to the other to get to the next Aufguss we had circled on our schedule. From the Good Morning Aufguss at 10:00 until the Good Night Aufguss at 11:30 p.m., we relaxed hard.  One that I have never sat through was the one that has an oven on the wall by the entrance and as you are in there, they put a loaf of bread in the oven to bake and you get slices of it at the end.  It wasn‚Äôt a super-hot sauna, so it seemed boring compared to the others.  üòä And believe it or not, after the first half hour, you really don‚Äôt even notice the nakedness around you and it doesn‚Äôt seem strange to ask some stranger to rub salt on your back.
